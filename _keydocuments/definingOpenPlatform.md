description: "There has been growing global interest in the concept of an Open Digital Platform for health and care based on open standards.<br><br>
In October 2017, we published “Defining an Open Platform” to make the case for open platforms and lay out a blueprint for an open platform architecture at a level of detail that would allow any willing party to build a first generation implementation of an open platform that would be interoperable with any other. Our proposal is based on HL7 FHIR, SNOMED-CT, IHE-XDS and openEHR and draws on pioneering work globally and in the UK that have proven how these standards can be used to build an open platform.<br><br>Since publication we have seen increasing interest in open platform approaches with open platform technology being implemented by a number of NHS Trusts, Genomics England and The City of Leeds for its PHR.<br><br>"
