name: IDCR - Medication Statement List.v1
description: The primary intent is to support a continuously curated life-long â€˜medication statement list ', as would be found in a GP system, PHR or other regional/national CDR but this should also be usable for episodic or departmental medication lists, which are generated at admission to a service e.g hospital admission, and maintained only during that episode of care or for that department. For clarity, this is NOT intended to be used in a prescribing system for the actual process of prescribing / dispensing, but is a static list of medications the patient is currently using/taking. It is also NOT intended to be used directly for the process of medication reconciliation, which would require some additional metadata.
