name: IDCR - Immunisations List.v0
description: The primary intent is to support a continuously curated life-long â€˜immunisations list', as would be found in a GP system, PHR or other regional/national CDR but this should also be usable for episodic or departmental immunisations lists, which are generated at admission to a service e.g hospital admission, and maintained only during that episode of care or for that department. The template uses an action archetype to represent the 'procedure performed' aspect of immunisations rather than focussing on the medication aspect which would be more appropriate in an encounter situation.
