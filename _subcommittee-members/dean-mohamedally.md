The IXN programme was reported in the NHS England Topol Review (2019), leading to the creation of this IXN for the NHS subcommittee at the government backed Apperta Foundation CIC. Outside of healthcare projects, the IXN programme is centred around term-time teaching with students based in our labs at UCL, with all sectors of industry clients engaging with the students on Proof of Concepts (PoC). Dean covers the fields of Software Engineering and Systems Integration development on the UCL IXN, but also align interests with our other UCL CS Projects Directors.
