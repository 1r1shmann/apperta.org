text: The OpenEyes Committee guides the development of OpenEyes™, the leading open source electronic patient record (EPR) for ophthalmology. It has been designed by clinicians to be fast in delivering content, fast to navigate and easy (and fun) to use. We benefit from from a large and growing body of enthusiastic clinicians determined to make OpenEyes™ the EPR that will help you deliver data-driven patient care in the best way possible. OpenEyes™ is owned by the community and not by any individual or corporate entity. It can be customised to suit local needs and will scale to connect, seamlessly, primary and secondary eye care.
